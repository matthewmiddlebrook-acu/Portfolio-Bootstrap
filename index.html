      <p class="text-left"></br>If you could have seen me as a kid, I probably would have been around technology. Teachers at elementary school would always ask me if they had problems with technology, because they knew that I would probably be able to help them.</br></br>

      Going into my Junior year of high school, I really didn't know what I wanted to do in college and would often say that I was Undecided. Taking Digital and Interactive Media, Graphic Design, and Computer Science in high school really helped shape me and help me know what I wanted to do.</br></br>

      Towards the end of my Senior year, I decided to be apart of McKinney High School's Literary Magazine. Though this after school club, we worked with the art and creative writing departments to design a 100 page magazine showcasing MHS student's work.</br></br>

      I kept asking God what I should do, but I was completely unaware with all the signs he was showing me. Everyone I asked what major I should be all told me the same thing: Digital Entertainment Technology. Reading up about the major, I knew it was a perfect fit for my skills. As I only applied to Abilene Christian University, people tried to get me to apply or visit other colleges, but I knew in my heart that God had big plans for me here.</br></br>

      However, my story doesn't stop there. At ACU, I have learned a tremendous amount about myself and the world we live in. I cannot wait to see how God will use me to further his kingdom.</p>
